"""Provide 2D simulations of frictional and non-frictional, crosslinked and non-crosslinked
 spheres under oscillatory shear.

The package provides the tools necessary to simulate ensembles of discrete spherical particles as described in
Otsuki, M. and H. Hayakawa, Discontinuous change of
shear modulus for frictional jammed granular materials. Phys Rev E, 2017. 95(6-1): p. 062902. In addition, the particles
can be crosslinked permanently between neighbors to constitute particles\n
