class CircleMass(Circle):
    """Provide a circle with an attribued mass

    Describes a sphere (circle in 2D) that possess a mass and stores the forces acting on the sphere. \n
    In a simulation, the concept is that before each
     simulation step, the force known to each sphere itself (the Ã¬nstance variables `particleShear.CircleMass.xforce` and
    `particleShear.CircleMass.yforce`) are reset to 0; as the spheres are meant to be associated with a simulation
     area object derived from `particleShear.CanvasPointsMass`, this typically happens through a call to the method
     `particleShear.CanvasPointsMass.reset_force` of `particleShear.CanvasPointsMass` or relevant subclass.
     In addition, for the purpose of stress tensor evaluation, details about
     the forces are registered during the various calculations in a simulation step in the
     `particleShear.CircleMass.force_register`, which is provided through the canvas class (derived from
     `particleShear.CanvasPointsMass`). At the beginning of each simulation step, the force register common to all the
     spheres on a simulaton canvas also needs to be reset, this is done via the
     `particleShear.CanvasPointsMass.reset_force_register` of `particleShear.CanvasPointsMass` or relevant subclass.\n
     When running the simulation, forces are calculated in various ways, and attributed to the sphere particles by direct
     change of the instance variables `particleShear.CircleMass.xforce` and
    `particleShear.CircleMass.yforce`. Depending on their nature, they are also registered in various ways in the common
     `particleShear.Force_register` object,
     which is the instance variable `particleShear.CanvasPointsMass.force_register` of the relevant subclass of
     `particleShear.CanvasPointsMass`; for practical purposes, this very same `particleShear.Force_register` is also known
     to each sphere as its own instance variable `particleShear.CircleMass.force_register`.\n
    Once all the forces known after a complete simulation step, the net force can be
    converted to acceleration (by explicit call to `particleShear.CircleMass.do_linear_acceleration`). This then
    calculates the change in speed due to the acceleration, and resets the force for the particle at hand to zero.
    At this point, the `particleShear.CircleMass.force_register`, common to all the spheres,
    still contains the detailed information about the forces and can
    be exploited for stress tensor evaluation by a `particleShear.StressTensorEvaluation` object. The
    `particleShear.CircleMass.force_register` needs to be reset separately prior to the next simulation step, see above.\n
