"""Provide 2D geometrical fricional and non-frictional objects (circles) and canvas areas to place, control and
 display them.

The package provides the tools necessary to simulate ensembles of discrete spherical particles as described in
Otsuki, M. and H. Hayakawa, Discontinuous change of
shear modulus for frictional jammed granular materials. Phys Rev E, 2017. 95(6-1): p. 062902.\n
